This project is about bit manipulation in c programming.
In C programming, bit manipulation refers to very low-level manipulation of the bits (0s and 1s) of variables. This entails altering a variable's bits directly as opposed to working with the complete value.

For bit manipulation on variables in C, use the bitwise operators (&, |,,, >>, etc.). Bit manipulation is frequently used to change or clear particular bits, compress data, or carry out quick arithmetic operations.
